<p>The Red Cross is a CCA that integrates character-building, leadership,
essential life saving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community
service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the
Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.</p>
<p>Our students learn important skills such as first aid, as well as develop
values such as compassion, passion and professionalism. They are trained
to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>

The Red Cross is a CCA that integrates character-building, leadership, essential life saving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.

Our students learn important skills such as first aid, as well as develop values such as compassion, passion and professionalism. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.

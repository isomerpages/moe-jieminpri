At the Modern Dance CCA, students are taught Modern Jazz and Ballet techniques. They become versatile and are able to adapt to different dance forms. They will also be exposed to short dance choreographies of different styles. Students will learn to improve their flexibility and co-ordination, gain musical and spatial awareness, and practise teamwork.

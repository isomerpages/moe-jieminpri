The Chinese Dance refers to dance forms that have traditional Chinese origins. It encompasses two main forms: Chinese classical ethnic dance and contemporary dance.

We are a vibrant and joyful community of student dancers who are able to appreciate and enjoy Chinese Dance and its culture. In addition, members get to appreciate dance as a performing art and develop greater self-discipline and perseverance.

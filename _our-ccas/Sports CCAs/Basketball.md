The Basketball CCA provides students the opportunity to hone basic basketball skills, such as ball handling and shooting techniques. As the boys train with their teammates, they foster camaraderie and learn to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses.

As they strive to succeed, the students also learn to be exemplary in their character and exhibit strong sportsmanship.

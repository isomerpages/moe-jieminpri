Floorball is rising in popularity in the local sports scene. Today, there are around 10,000 active floorball players in Singapore, with more than 200 schools introducing the sport to their students. The Singapore Floorball National Team is a powerhouse within the region.  

Conventionally played in a floorball rink, teams are usually made up of 5 players including a goalkeeper. There are three periods of 10 minutes each for a standard floorball game in the primary school tournaments.

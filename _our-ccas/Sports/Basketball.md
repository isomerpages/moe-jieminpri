<p>The Basketball CCA provides students the opportunity to hone basic basketball
skills, such as ball handling and shooting techniques. As the boys train
with their teammates, they foster camaraderie and learn to understand each
other's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>As they strive to succeed, the students also learn to be exemplary in
their character and exhibit strong sportsmanship.</p>

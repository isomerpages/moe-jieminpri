<p>The Chinese Dance refers to dance forms that have traditional Chinese
origins. It encompasses two main forms: Chinese classical ethnic dance
and contemporary dance.</p>
<p>We are a vibrant and joyful community of student dancers who are able
to appreciate and enjoy Chinese Dance and its culture. In addition, members
get to appreciate dance as a performing art and develop greater self-discipline
and perseverance.</p>

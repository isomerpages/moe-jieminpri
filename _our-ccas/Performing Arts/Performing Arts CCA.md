The Performing Arts CCAs aim to develop our Jieminitesâ€™ interest and talent in music and dance. These CCAs provide opportunities for our students to practise in authentic learning experiences, as they demonstrate their learning at school events and external competitions. As they hone their skills, the students interact and work in teams with their peers from other levels, and forge friendships and inculcate the school values.

<p>The angklung is a widely practised ethnic musical instrument in South-east
Asia. As the nature of angklung music is ensemble-based, pupils learn to
be team-players and gain 21st century competencies.
<br>We hope to develop our students in the Angklung Ensemble to become excellent
musicians with a heart of service, through a balanced enrichment programme
to nurture them to their fullest potential and inculcate in them sound
moral values.</p>

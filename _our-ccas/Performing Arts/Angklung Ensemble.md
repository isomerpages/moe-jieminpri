The angklung is a widely practised ethnic musical instrument in South-east Asia. As the nature of angklung music is ensemble-based, pupils learn to be team-players and gain 21st century competencies. <br>
We hope to develop our students in the Angklung Ensemble to become excellent musicians with a heart of service, through a balanced enrichment programme to nurture them to their fullest potential and inculcate in them sound moral values.

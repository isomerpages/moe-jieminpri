Members of the Journalist Club get to explore news reporting and writing, as well as photojournalism. These skills are aligned with our schoolâ€™s Applied Learning Programme "Journalist in the Making". Acquiring these skills, members explore social and cultural issues, and also build their confidence in expression.

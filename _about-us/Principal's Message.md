</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2025, Jiemin Primary School will proudly celebrate
its 40th Anniversary. Our theme, "Jiemin@40 ~ Nurturing Minds, Inspiring
Futures!" reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering the growth of
every child, both in and out of the classroom. Over the past four decades,
we have had the privilege of shaping the hearts and minds of countless
students, preparing them for the challenges and opportunities of the future.
Central to this journey has been our focus on developing 21st-century skills,
particularly critical and adaptive thinking skills that empower our students
to navigate an ever-changing world with confidence, creativity, and resilience.</p>
<p>In this celebratory year, our mission to nurture both hearts and minds
remains steadfast. We are dedicated to a holistic education that develops
character and academic excellence, guided by our values of Responsibility,
Respect, Humility, Resilience, and Care. Through authentic learning opportunities,
including camps, learning journeys, and participation in events such as
the Singapore Youth Festival and the National School Games, we aim to inspire
curiosity, resilience, and active learning among our students.</p>
<p>This anniversary also provides an opportunity to honor our past while
embracing the future. With the collective support of parents, staff, and
the wider community, we are confident in preparing our students to excel
in a dynamic world while staying true to our shared vision of raising Global
Learners and Discerning Citizens.</p>
<p>On behalf of Vice-Principal Ms. Nur Fatimah, Vice-Principal Ms. Joy Wong,

a fulfilling and inspiring school year ahead. Let us make 2025 a memorable
year of celebration, growth, and success for all.</p>

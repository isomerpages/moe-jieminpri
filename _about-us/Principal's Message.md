Dear Parents/Guardians and Jieminites,

  

Happy New Year 2023! 

We hope that you and your family had opportunity in December to spend quality time with your family and loved ones. We are grateful for all the learning opportunities in 2022, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our parents, community members and all staff members for their contribution and support for a successful year.

We are excited to start the new 2023 Academic Year by welcoming six new classes of Primary 1 pupils to our school. I am confident that our older Jieminites will be good role models to our new batch of P1 Jieminites. Together with the support of parents and the community, we will strive to bring out the very best in each child.

Our mission at Jiemin Primary School will continue to focus on Nurturing Hearts and Minds of our pupils. We aim to develop our pupils holistically, and that requires us to constantly review our programmes and activities. Every child must be developed in strength of character and at the same time, be supported in their pursuit for academic excellence. We will endeavour to develop their positive learning dispositions of “Active Learning”, “Resilience” and “Curiosity”, and remain guided by our values of Responsibility, Respect, Humility, Resilience and Care.

In 2023, we hope to be able to explore more authentic learning opportunities such as cohort camps and learning journeys which had at times been limited due to Covid-19 over the last 3 years. We will remain cautious as safety for all is a top priority. While the pandemic was disruptive, it also provided us many opportunities to develop other skillsets. We will continue to leverage the gains we have made in ICT enabled-learning and leverage online platforms for learning and communications, such as MOE’s Student Learning Space (SLS).

Let us all come together to encourage our student to explore their interests, passion and aspirations in this new academic year as we strive to achieve our vision of being \`Global Learners, Discerning Citizens’. 

On behalf of Vice-Principal Ms Nur Fatimah, Vice-Principal Ms Joy Wong, and all staff, we wish you a Happy New Year!

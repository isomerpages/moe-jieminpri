Dear Parents/Guardians and Jieminites,

  

A warm welcome and Happy New Year 2022! 

  

As we start our new journey in 2022, we are grateful for all our growth, learning and achievements in 2021. Let us enter the New Year with a renewed sense of purpose and mission, and be committed to the well-being and growth of every Jieminite. This year, we are most happy to welcome 7 new classes of Primary 1 pupils to our school.

  

At Jiemin, we have set ourselves the mission of Nurturing Hearts and Minds. We believe in holistic education, and we will continue to develop and evolve our programmes to nurture our Jieminites. We will focus on the development of their strength of character and support them in their pursuit for academic excellence. Guided by our core values of Responsibility, Respect, Humility, Resilience and Care, we seek the support of parents and the community to collaborate with all of us at Jiemin to bring out the very best in our Jieminites. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. We thank you and look forward to your support in 2022.

  

The past 2 years of living with COVID-19 has certainly affected our routines and plans. The pandemic has also provided opportunity for all of us to be resilient as we developed new skills and approaches to ensure that learning and growing continues for all at Jiemin. While technology has been central to many of our plans, the effectiveness of using technology can be amplified when pupils develop positive learning dispositions and have a sense of responsibility for their own learning. We will continue to inculcate positive learning dispositions of “Active Learning”, “Resilience” and “Curiosity”, as well as helping our Jieminites to be familiar with key online learning platforms such as MOE’s Student Learning Space (SLS) and using video conferencing platforms.

Together with Ms Nur Fatimah, Ms Joy Wong, and all staff, we wish you the very best for 2022 and let us strive together towards our vision of being 'Global Learners, Discerning Citizens’. 
  

Once again, wishing everyone a Happy New Year!

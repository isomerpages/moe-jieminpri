Dear Parents/Guardians and Jieminites, 

A very Happy New School Year 2024 to everyone! 

We trust that you and your families have enjoyed a rejuvenating break in the past few weeks, filled with cherished moments and the warmth of loved ones. Reflecting on the achievements and growth of the previous academic year, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to parents, community members, and our dedicated staff for their unwavering support, commitment, and contributions. 

As we embark on the new 2024 Academic Year, we are thrilled to extend a warm welcome to our newest members - seven vibrant classes of Primary 1 students. To our returning students, we look forward to witnessing your continued growth, leadership and mentorship, as you guide the newest additions to our school community. With the collective support of parents and the wider community, we are poised to bring out the very best in each child. 

At the heart of Jiemin Primary School lies our enduring mission to nurture both hearts and minds. Our commitment to holistic development remains steadfast, necessitating a continuous review of our programs and activities. We aim to cultivate strength of character alongside academic excellence, fostering positive learning dispositions such as "Active Learning”, "Resilience” and "Curiosity”. Our values - Responsibility, Respect, Humility, Resilience, and Care - will serve as guiding principles throughout the academic journey. 

In the coming year, we aspire to explore a multitude of authentic learning opportunities, including camps and learning journeys. With your support, we are optimistic about creating enriching experiences for our students. Our Jieminites will also be participating in the Singapore Youth Festival and the annual National School Games. We actively encourage Jieminites to explore their talents in the aesthetics and sports as part of their holistic development. 

Let us unite in encouraging our students to delve into their interests, passions and aspirations. Together, we strive towards our shared vision of producing "Global Learners, Discerning Citizens." On behalf of Vice-Principal Ms. Nur Fatimah, Vice-Principal Ms. Joy Wong and our entire staff, we extend our warmest wishes for a successful and fulfilling new school year. Here's to a year of growth, learning and achievement!

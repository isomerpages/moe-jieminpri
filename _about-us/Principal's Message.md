<p><strong>Dear Parents/Guardians and Jieminites,</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A very happy New School Year 2026 to all!</strong>
</p>
<p>We hope this message finds you and your families well-rested and rejuvenated
after the holiday season, ready to embark on an exciting and meaningful
year ahead. The past academic year has been one of growth and achievements,
and we remain deeply grateful to our parents, staff, and community partners
for your unwavering support and contributions, which have been instrumental
in shaping our school’s success.</p>
<p>At Jiemin Primary School, our unwavering commitment is to foster the holistic
growth of every child, both in and beyond the classroom. Over the past
four decades, we have had the privilege of shaping the hearts and minds
of generations of learners, preparing them to meet future challenges with
confidence. Central to this journey is our focus on developing 21st-century
competencies, particularly critical and adaptive thinking—skills that empower
our students to navigate an ever-changing world with creativity, resilience,
and purpose. Our mission to nurture both hearts and minds remains steadfast.
Guided by our core values of <strong>Responsibility, Respect, Humility, Resilience, and Care</strong>,
we strive to provide a holistic education that develops strong character
alongside academic excellence. Through authentic learning experiences such
as camps, learning journeys, and participation in events like the Singapore
Youth Festival and the National School Games, we aim to spark curiosity,
build resilience, and cultivate a lifelong love for learning in every Jieminite.</p>
<p>We are delighted to extend a warm welcome to our newest Jieminites— our
Primary One pupils and their families. To our returning students, we look
forward to seeing you continue to grow and shine as learners, leaders,
and role models, especially as we commemorate this meaningful milestone
together as a school community.</p>
<p>With the collective support of parents, staff, and our wider community,
we are confident in preparing our students to thrive in a dynamic world,
while staying true to our shared vision of nurturing <strong>Global Learners and Discerning Citizens</strong>.</p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to share that our long-serving
Vice-Principal, <strong>Ms Nur Fatimah</strong>, will be leaving Jiemin
Primary School. A passionate educator and dedicated leader, Ms Fatimah
has made invaluable contributions to the growth and success of both our
pupils and staff over the years. We are certain that our Jieminites will
remember her fondly, and we wish her every success as she takes on her
new appointment as Vice-Principal of Northview Primary School. On behalf
of all Jieminites, past and present, we extend our heartfelt appreciation
and best wishes to her in her future endeavours.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are pleased to warmly welcome <strong>Mr Ahmad Zakir bin Mokhtar </strong>as
our new Vice-Principal. Mr Zakir is a Humanities educator by training,
specialising in History and Geography. He previously served as Head of
Department for Humanities at Northbrooks Secondary School and also worked
at the Ministry of Education’s Curriculum Planning and Development Division,
where he contributed to the development of the Geography syllabuses. In
his leadership roles, he has led initiatives to strengthen students’ 21st-century
competencies, supporting their holistic development and future readiness.
Mr Zakir looks forward to working closely with our staff and parents to
support every child’s growth and love of learning at Jiemin.</p>
<p>On behalf of Vice-Principal Mr Zakir, Vice-Principal Ms Joy Wong, and
our dedicated team of educators, we extend our heartfelt wishes for a fulfilling,
joyful, and inspiring school year ahead. Let us work together to make 2026
a memorable year of celebration, growth, and success for all.</p>

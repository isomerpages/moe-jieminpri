Jiemin Primary School started operations at Yishun Street 71 in January 1985 with 23 classes and was holding another 16 classes for Peixin Primary School. In March that year, another 13 classes from West Hill Primary School joined the school making a total of 52 classes. However, in June of the same year, Peixin pupils moved into their own premises in Yishun Ring Road.

  

The name of the school, Jiemin, originates from two traditional Chinese schools, Jiegu and Quanmin Public Schools, which were located at Bukit Merah before their closure in 1984.

  

Our priority has always been to provide a holistic, meaningful and well-balanced education for our pupils. We place great emphasis on academic excellence as well as in Co-Curricular Activities. We also believe in creating a safe and conducive environment for our pupils' learning.

This year we commemorated Racial Harmony Day on Monday, 22 July 2013 in school following the theme “Celebrating Singapore!”

We celebrated our diversity and richness as both pupils and teachers came in different ethnic costumes. During assembly, there were activities for both teachers and pupils to take part in activities such as blow painting, sari and sarong tying within a given time. Needless to say, both the pupils and teachers had a great time bonding and learning more about the different cultures.

  

### National Day Celebration 2013

This year, our nation celebrated Singapore’s 48th birthday on 9th August 2013. We celebrate National Day each year to imbue national pride and a sense of belonging in our pupils.

  

The theme for this year’s National Day is “Many Stories… One Singapore”. Everyone has a story to remember and share. These stories can be about our personal journey, both individually and collectively as a society. They can also be about our hopes and aspirations. These are the stories that make us who we are and how we identify ourselves as Singaporeans.

  

To provide this learning experience for our pupils, 7 August was dedicated for us to celebrate this year’s National Day as a school. The day began with a flag march in and the singing of the National Anthem. Next, there was a recollection that reminded everyone of Singapore’s struggles and aspirations. The day ended very light heartedly with a list of in-class activities for the students and a sing-a-along session.

  

On the whole, it was a day enriched with fun and interesting lessons for the students. Here are a few snapshots of the day’s activities!

  

### Assembly Programme: Survivor Stories (Drama)

Among the various activities held in celebration of our 48th National Day, pupils enjoyed a drama performance during the school assembly on 12 Aug 2013. It was an engaging play entitled, “Survivor Stories”. In line with the National Day theme, “Many Stories, One Singapore”, the audience learnt of stories told from the point of view of different people who lived during the war and the Japanese occupation. Among them were a Malay mother, a Chinese shopkeeper, an Indian coolie, a Japanese military officer and a POW.

  

### National Day Parade Preview 2013

A fun and colourful carnival set such an excitement for our P5 pupils as they sat in the arena to watch the stories of Singapore unfold at the NDP Preview Show on the 20 July 2013. This year’s theme of ‘Many stories, One Singapore’ showcased the diversity and uniqueness of Singaporeans in an entertaining and humorous way which brought laughter and etched memorable moments in our pupils.

  

The MRT train rides to The Float@Marina and return trip to school were also good bonding time between teachers and pupils. It was all worth the while.

### CCE (Character & Citizenship Education)

In Jiemin Primary, the CCE (Character and Citizenship Education) department plans and oversees a broad range of activities that aim to achieve the vision of developing Jieminites who show love for family, community and country through their display of school values. The following are highlights of what our students get to experience:

### New CCE Walls and Corners

Jiemin’s CCE Committee has been busy transforming different parts of the school over years. Walls have been filled up with pictures and write-ups about the rich history of our country, community and school. An area in front of the canteen has also been revamped into a traditional games corner featuring nostalgic local games. These efforts aim to promote our national identity and allow our pupils to have a better appreciation of our heritage and culture. - Mr Ng Ban Hock, SH CCE

### Values In Action


Since the beginning of 2016, our pupils have been engaging in a range of meaningful VIA (Values In Action) activities. Our school’s VIA theme – Our Environment, Our Future – aims to raise awareness on key environmental issues affecting our society. From Canteen cleanliness campaign to ‘Green the school’ project to Litter picking at our community park, both teachers and students have been actively involved in contributing to the environment of our school and community. Through the VIA learning experiences, the school hopes to achieve our vision of nurturing Discerning Citizen who are socially responsible and contributes meaningfully to the community.

### Classroom Cleanliness Campaign (School-Wide VIA)

Starting from this year, every pupil from Primary 1 to Primary 6 is involved in keeping their classrooms and corridors clean. Cleaning activities such as sweeping the floors, arranging tables and chairs, cleaning the whiteboards are carried out daily. This aims to inculcate values such as responsibility as well as care and respect for the environment. Teachers on duty will check and monitor the cleanliness of the classrooms. Certificates are presented to classes that are consistently clean and tidy, and the cleanest class of every level are awarded a bunting flag. – Mdm Susan Koh (VIA Coordinator)

### Recess Newspapers Recycling (School-Wide VIA)

Every fortnight, the school will collect old newspapers from every class. This is to encourage all Jieminites to develop the right values and lifelong habits to do their part for the environment. Recycling Corners are set up in the classrooms to ensure that newspapers are placed and stacked up neatly. Class representatives will send the newspapers down to the recycling bins station during recess. Newspapers are weighed to keep track of the amount contributed by every class. – Mdm Susan Koh (VIA Coordinator)

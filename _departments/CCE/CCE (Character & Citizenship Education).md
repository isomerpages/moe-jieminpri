### CCE (Character & Citizenship Education)

In Jiemin Primary, the CCE (Character and Citizenship Education) department plans and oversees a broad range of activities that aim to achieve the vision of developing Jieminites who show love for family, community and country through their display of school values. The following are highlights of what our students get to experience:

### New CCE Walls and Corners

Jieminâ€™s CCE Committee has been busy transforming different parts of the school over years. Walls have been filled up with pictures and write-ups about the rich history of our country, community and school. An area in front of the canteen has also been revamped into a traditional games corner featuring nostalgic local games. These efforts aim to promote our national identity and allow our pupils to have a better appreciation of our heritage and culture. - Mr Ng Ban Hock, SH CCE

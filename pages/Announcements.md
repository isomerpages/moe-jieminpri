### Start of School 2023
Here at Jiemin Primary School, we look forward to welcoming all Jieminites for the year of 2023. Please refer to the attached letter on matters pertaining to the school reopening for your action prior to your child's reporting to school next week.

All Primary 2 to 6 students will report for school from Wed, 4 Jan 2023 onwards. 

We would like to take this opportunity to wish all our Jieminites and parents a Happy New Year 2023.

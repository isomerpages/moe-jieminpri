### Start of School 2023
Here at Jiemin Primary School, we look forward to welcoming all Jieminites for the year of 2023. Please refer to the attached letter on matters pertaining to the school reopening for your action prior to your child's reporting to school next week.

All Primary 2 to 6 students will report for school from Wed, 4 Jan 2023 onwards. We have also attached the letter dated 14 Nov 2022 with information on the list of things to bring to school next week. This letter was given to your child on the last day of school on the same date.

We would like to take this opportunity to wish all our Jieminites and parents a Happy New Year 2023.

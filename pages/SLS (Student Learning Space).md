## Introduction

As part of our commitment to nurture future-ready learners, all students in Singapore schools are supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.  


With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology.  Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience. With the provision of SLS, our teachers aim to develop self-directed and collaborative learning in our students. 

Below are some information to assist your child in resolving login issues. We will do our best to assist in resetting password and unlocking account which depends on the volume of requests as well as the accuracy of the information provided. We seek your understanding should it take longer than you expected.   


We look forward to your support as we help our students strengthen their learning through the SLS.

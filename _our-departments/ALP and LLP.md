<h3>ALP - Journalist in the Making</h3>

One of our niche areas is our **Applied Learning Programme (ALP), "Journalist in the Making"**. The focus areas are building the students' confidence in expression through our various targeted level programmes such as P1 Choral Reading Workshop, P2 Poetry Recitation, P3 Puppetry, Storytelling, Journalist Club, etc.

Our ALP was highlighted in The Straits Times, Education Section, on 15 Aug 2016.

<h3>ALP-IPW - Endangered Animals</h3>

The **Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)** is a collaboration between the English Language and Mother Tongue Language Departments. The programme aims to provide opportunities for our Jieminites to be aware of the current global issues like environmental sustainability and conservation, in promoting self-directed learning, and responsibility towards nature and the environment around them.

Starting with the theme ‘Endangered Animals’ our youngest Jieminites in Primary 1 have a chance to view the animals from their classrooms through an online virtual tour to the Singapore Zoo. They learn how these animals depend on their environment to survive, and how humans can avoid creating harm to the creatures and their natural habitats. Incorporating the school’s value of Care, the pupils are made aware that some of our actions can lead to these animals becoming endangered. As a follow-up, these Jieminites demonstrate their learning by presenting the information they gathered through Show-and-Tell sessions during their English and Mother Tongue Languages lessons. They also reflect on their roles on how they can help to prevent these animals from becoming extinct.




<h3>LLP - Aesthetics Alive (Music and Performing Arts)</h3>

The **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)** with the theme, Aesthetics Alive, focuses on Jieminites mastering their skills in music-making and the performing arts. The programme develop our Jieminites' their creative skills, allowing them to find their own voice, build confidence, learn effective ways of communications, and transform ideas into actions. 

The programme also aims to inculcate a sense of belonging to Singapore, as Jieminites explore their interests and passion for the arts through activities that help them understand the Singapore heritage.

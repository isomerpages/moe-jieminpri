FAS application period would start sometime from mid-September to October.

<h5><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Payment of School Fees</a></h5>
<p>We encourage parents to pay school fees via non-cash channels (eg. either
by GIRO, directly via iBanking or at AXS machines), so that your child
does not need to carry cash to school to pay for the school fees with the
risk of losing his/her wallet.</p>
<p>If you have not opted for GIRO payment, you can do so by filling in the
GIRO authorisation form which can be obtained from the General Office.
Deductions by GIRO is made every 26th of the month (except for January,
where there would be a 2 month deduction in February).</p>
<p>If you wish to pay via cash (provided you are not on GIRO scheme), please
note that the hours for cash collection at the General Office is as follows:</p>

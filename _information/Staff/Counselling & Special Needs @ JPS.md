### Working with Children, Adolescents and their Parents

At Jiemin Primary the safety and well being of our pupils is of paramount importance. By listening to their stories, employing effective interventions, advocating for them, and educating parents and other professionals about child and adolescent development and other important issues, we can make our pupils’ journey through life more fulfilling and successful.
 
### School Counseling Services
 
The Counseling Office (Caravan) takes a proactive, pupil-centered, and developmental approach in working with pupils, teachers, parents and community services. Through consultation and collaboration a balanced education is maintained where the focus is on academic instruction and pupil building. Counseling services are available for pupils to help them identify difficulties and empower them with coping strategies.
 
### Counseling Referral System
* For our pupils’ well being, a four stage referral process is in place at the School.
* At the first stage, Form Teachers who have the trust and confidence of their pupils will listen and guide the pupils.
* Where further assistance is required Teacher Counselors trained in counseling will provide guidance to pupils at the second referral stage.
* The School Counselor at the third stage will receive directly cases that are referred by teachers, parents and self referral by pupils.
* At the fourth stage, pupils who may require further support and interventions for mental health, learning and other emotional and behavioral difficulties will be referred to external agencies.

### STELLAR 2.0

The STELLAR 2.0 Programme is an updated version of the STELLAR programme, supporting the new English Language Syllabus 2020. It has been revised to better equip learners for changes in language use, such as the increasing importance of linguistic and communication skills, adaptability, and flexibility in a changing global environment. This includes advancements in infomation technology influencing literacy skills and the inclusion of multiliteracies in English. The programme also focuses on preparing learners for future workplace demands, emphasizing interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and information systems skills.

While the STELLAR2.0 program fosters a love for reading and a strong English language foundation in students, language learning in the 21st century must encompass various competencies to prepare youth for the digital age. EL teaching practices are being re-evaluated to meet the communication demands of today's students through the key shifts in ELS2020.


  

### School Support Programs

#### Learning Support Program 2.0

The Learning Support Programme (LSP) was introduced in all primary schools in 1992 to provide additional support to students lacking in early reading skills. A review in 2005 found that systematic phonics instruction in small groups improved students' English language and literacy skills. In 2017, the LSP was further aligned with the mainstream EL STELLAR programme. LSP 2.0, piloted in 15 primary schools in 2018 and 2019, showed improved word reading outcomes. It was fully implemented in all primary schools by 2021.

#### P4 LET’S (Learn English Thro’ Storyboarding)

This year Jiemin will continue our storyboarding programme for the P4 pupils. The pupils will be trained to use the skills in storyboarding for writing.

  

Teachers will also be using these skills to help the pupils improve in their Composition Writing.

  

#### P5 and P6 Fun and Engaging English Lessons (FEEL)

This programme is designed to help pupils to become better and more enthusiastic readers and writers. Pupils are expected to look for a certain element of literature in the story, such as setting or theme or point of view and become more sophisticated readers.

  

At the same time, these pupils will understand how and why a particular story works and become more appreciative of good writing. They can be more conscious there in writing with elements of literature into their own stories.

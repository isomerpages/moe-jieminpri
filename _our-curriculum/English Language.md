###   STELLAR 2.0

The STELLAR 2.0 Programme is an updated version of the STELLAR programme, supporting the new English Language Syllabus 2020. It has been revised to better equip learners for changes in language use, such as the increasing importance of linguistic and communication skills, adaptability, and flexibility in a changing global environment. This includes advancements in infomation technology influencing literacy skills and the inclusion of multiliteracies in English. The programme also focuses on preparing learners for future workplace demands, emphasizing interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and information systems skills.

While the STELLAR2.0 program fosters a love for reading and a strong English language foundation in students, language learning in the 21st century must encompass various competencies to prepare youth for the digital age. EL teaching practices are being re-evaluated to meet the communication demands of today's students through the key shifts in ELS2020.


  

###   School Support Programs

#### Learning Support Program 2.0

The Learning Support Programme (LSP) was introduced in all primary schools in 1992 to provide additional support to students lacking in early reading skills. A review in 2005 found that systematic phonics instruction in small groups improved students' English language and literacy skills. In 2017, the LSP was further aligned with the mainstream EL STELLAR programme. LSP 2.0, piloted in 15 primary schools in 2018 and 2019, showed improved word reading outcomes. It was fully implemented in all primary schools by 2021.

The school-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme 2.0 is an intensive literacy intervention for Primary 3 and 4 students with dyslexia.

#### I-pen Reading Program


The "Reading Begins at Home" programme is a two-year English Language initiative aimed at improving Jieminites' reading skills through structured activities at home. It focuses on enhancing comprehension, vocabulary, and overall language proficiency by encouraging consistent reading practices. The programme empowers parents to actively support and monitor their children's reading progress.

A key goal of the programme is to strengthen parent-child relationships through shared reading experiences. By making reading a collaborative family activity, it aims to foster a positive attitude towards reading and learning among children.

The initiative is designed to boost Jieminites' language skills and reading confidence. Regular parental involvement is expected to cultivate good reading habits, potentially leading to improved academic performance. By providing support at home, the programme aims to motivate children and develop their engagement with English language learning, promoting lifelong reading and critical thinking skills.



#### KidsRead Club



The KidsREAD program is a dynamic initiative designed to cultivate a profound love for reading among Jieminites and instil enduring, pleasurable reading habits. By immersing Jieminites in weekly interactive reading sessions, the program transforms reading into an engaging, accessible, and positive experience, ultimately bolstering literacy and comprehension skills. The involvement of student volunteers from Yishun Secondary School provides our Jieminites with relatable role models whom our Jieminites could learn from. Hence, promoting peer learning and social interaction across the age groups. This connection between Jieminites and the student volunteers can significantly enhance the younger participants' motivation, transforming reading from a potentially solitary task into an engaging, collaborative activity. The peer-to-peer interaction creates a dynamic learning environment weekly.


#### MyOn



The objective of myON is to provide students with a personalized reading experience that aligns with their unique interests, reading levels, and grade levels. By offering a vast library of over 7,000 digital books, it aims to nurture a love for reading, improve literacy skills, and empower students to take charge of their learning journey. The tailored recommendations and close reading tools within myON encourage students to read more frequently and at an appropriate difficulty level, which builds confidence and reading fluency.

Primary 4 and Primary 5 Jieminites are on the myON program. This program has a significant positive impact by fostering higher engagement and motivation to read. By catering to each Jieminite’s preferences and skill level, it caters to the needs of the of the different readers.  We hope this program can lead to an increase for the love of reading. The interactive features and supports, such as highlighting and note-taking, can also help Jieminites practice critical reading skills and develop a deeper understanding of texts.

#### P5 and P6 Fun and Engaging English Lessons (FEEL)

This programme is designed to help pupils to become better and more enthusiastic readers and writers. Pupils are expected to look for a certain element of literature in the story, such as setting or theme or point of view and become more sophisticated readers.

  

At the same time, these pupils will understand how and why a particular story works and become more appreciative of good writing. They can be more conscious there in writing with elements of literature into their own stories.

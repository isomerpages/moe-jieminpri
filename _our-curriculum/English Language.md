### STELLAR 2.0

The STELLAR 2.0 Programme is an updated version of the STELLAR programme, supporting the new English Language Syllabus 2020. It has been revised to better equip learners for changes in language use, such as the increasing importance of linguistic and communication skills, adaptability, and flexibility in a changing global environment. This includes advancements in infomation technology influencing literacy skills and the inclusion of multiliteracies in English. The programme also focuses on preparing learners for future workplace demands, emphasizing interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and information systems skills.

While the STELLAR2.0 program fosters a love for reading and a strong English language foundation in students, language learning in the 21st century must encompass various competencies to prepare youth for the digital age. EL teaching practices are being re-evaluated to meet the communication demands of today's students through the key shifts in ELS2020.


  

### School Support Programs

#### Learning Support Program 2.0



  

#### P3 Stellar cum Guided Reading

The school recognizes the value and significance of reading as it opens the door to the world of knowledge and information for our pupils. The school’s commitment to Guided Reading arises from the desire to help pupils learn to use independent reading strategies successfully and thereby hone their comprehension skills.

  

The programme serves to provide useful scaffolds to support the pupil as a developing reader. In this process, the teacher is not just facilitating or ‘doing’ reading but is teaching reading. The programme sets out to mould confident, independent and critical readers, who thoroughly enjoy reading.

  

This year the school is carrying the Guided Reading Programme. As we are embarking on STELLAR this year, we have decided to incorporate the reading strategies in Guided Reading into STELLAR. This will further enhance the pupils’ reading abilities.

  

#### P4 LET’S (Learn English Thro’ Storyboarding)

This year Jiemin will continue our storyboarding programme for the P4 pupils. The pupils will be trained to use the skills in storyboarding for writing.

  

Teachers will also be using these skills to help the pupils improve in their Composition Writing.

  

#### P5 and P6 Fun and Engaging English Lessons (FEEL)

This programme is designed to help pupils to become better and more enthusiastic readers and writers. Pupils are expected to look for a certain element of literature in the story, such as setting or theme or point of view and become more sophisticated readers.

  

At the same time, these pupils will understand how and why a particular story works and become more appreciative of good writing. They can be more conscious there in writing with elements of literature into their own stories.

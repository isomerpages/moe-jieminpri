###   STELLAR 2.0

The STELLAR 2.0 Programme is an updated version of the STELLAR programme, supporting the new English Language Syllabus 2020. It has been revised to better equip learners for changes in language use, such as the increasing importance of linguistic and communication skills, adaptability, and flexibility in a changing global environment. This includes advancements in infomation technology influencing literacy skills and the inclusion of multiliteracies in English. The programme also focuses on preparing learners for future workplace demands, emphasizing interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and information systems skills.

While the STELLAR2.0 program fosters a love for reading and a strong English language foundation in students, language learning in the 21st century must encompass various competencies to prepare youth for the digital age. EL teaching practices are being re-evaluated to meet the communication demands of today's students through the key shifts in ELS2020.

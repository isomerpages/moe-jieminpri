<p>At Jiemin Primary School, we believe that digital literacy is not a standalone
subject â€” it is a way of learning. Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) is woven into every subject, enabling our students to learn, create,
and collaborate in meaningful ways. From the first day of school to graduation,
our students experience an ICT-integrated curriculum designed to nurture
them as self-directed learners, critical thinkers, and responsible digital
citizens.</p>
<h3>ICT in Every Classroom</h3>
<p>Our teachers embed technology into daily lessons across all subject areas
â€” from English and Mother Tongue Languages to Mathematics, Science, Art,
and Music. Interactive platforms, digital tools, and multimedia resources
bring lessons to life, making learning more engaging and personalised.
Whether it is conducting research for a Science inquiry task, using creative
apps for Art, or collaborating on a shared document for an English project,
students experience ICT as a natural part of their learning process.</p>

<h3>Building Digital Competencies</h3>
<p>In line with the MOE National Digital Literacy Programme, students progressively
acquire ICT baseline skills and digital literacy competencies as they move
from Lower Primary to Upper Primary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lower Primary â€“ Touch typing, safe navigation in online spaces, logging
into digital platforms like the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS),
and basic device operations.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle Primary â€“ Word processing, creating presentations, researching
online safely, and digital art creation using apps such as Procreate.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Primary â€“ Digital music creation (GarageBand), block-based programming
through the Code for Fun programme, computational thinking, and coding.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These competencies are taught within the context of different subjects,
so students learn to apply them in authentic, purposeful ways. By the time
they leave Jiemin, they are confident in using technology to learn, communicate,
and solve problems.</p>
<h3>Learning Beyond the Classroom</h3>
<p>ICT also empowers self-directed learning. Students use digital platforms
to extend their learning beyond school hours â€” exploring online resources,
revisiting lesson materials, or working on personal projects. They are
encouraged to take ownership of their learning pace, deepen their understanding,
and pursue their interests with technology as a tool for discovery.</p>

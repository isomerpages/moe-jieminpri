## Vision

Self-directed and discerning Science learners who are ignited with passion for continuous exploration.  
  

## Mission

To spark curiosity, interest and creativity in the learning of Science.


## The Science curriculum aims to:

1\. Provide pupils with experiences which build their interests and stimulate their curiosity about their environment;

2\. Provide pupils with basic scientific terms and concepts to help them understand and the world around them

3\. Provide pupils with opportunities to develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry

4\. Prepare pupils towards using scientific knowledge and methods in making personal decisions.

&nbsp;These are the programmes planned for pupils from P3 to P6

## 1. Inquiry-based learning through hands-on activities


The hands-on activities using apparatus in the science laboratory will allow pupils to be engaged in meaningful exploration as they conduct experiments to make deductions on key Science concepts. They will analyse the data collected to track trends and patterns to arrive at conclusions.

## 2. Science is fun through experiential learning


\-Magic of Science

This programme provides opportunity for pupils to create their own science experiments and to showcase their work or invention by presenting it to their classmates at the concourse. It also allows pupils to be creative and to simulate ideas when they are crafting and designing their experiments.

\- Science Busker Competition

Every year, we send our pupils to participate in the Science Busker Competition organized by Science Centre. In 2023, our pupils won the Judges Awards for the best experiment presented during the competition.

\-Learning Journey

Every year, we provide other learning platforms for our pupils to learn science beyond their classroom.&nbsp; For instance, Primary Three pupils would visit Urban Farming to learn about diversity of plants that is related to topics covered in Primary Three science lessons. Primary Five pupils would discover interesting science concepts learnt during their school-based science fair while the Primary Six pupils would take a trip to a Sustainability tour organized by NEA. Not forgetting the Primary Four pupils, they would be engaged in Science and Technology programme.

## Stretch Programme for Science - E2K


In Jiemin, we provide a platform for pupils to experience what a scientist does in the laboratory. In this enrichment programme, pupils will be working on open experiments that they have to formulate research questions, plan the experiment protocol, define what equipment they need, perform the experiment, present the results, and draw conclusion. Hence, we offer E2K science for pupils who have such curiosity and motivation to solve the challenge.

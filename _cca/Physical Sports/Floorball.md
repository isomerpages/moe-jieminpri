### Vision

To create and build awareness of the sport at school and national level.

### Mission

To develop the 21st core competencies in every floorball player.

### What is our CCA about ?

Floorball is rapidly rising in popularity in Singapore. The Singapore Floorball National Team is a powerhouse within the region.  
Conventionally played in a floorball rink, teams are usually made up of 5 players including a goal keeper. There are three periods of 10 minutes each for a standard floorball game in the primary school tournaments.

* Learn more in-depth floorball skills apart from PE lessons like dribbling, slap hit, drag shot and aerials.  
* Through our friendly matches and competition, we gained lots of experiences and grow stronger as a team.

<p>Jiemin Primary School is celebrating its 40th Anniversary this year. Our
theme, "Jiemin@40 ~ Nurturing Minds, Inspiring Futures!" reflects our unwavering
commitment to fostering the growth of every child, both in and out of the
classroom. Over the past four decades, we have had the privilege of shaping
the hearts and minds of countless students, preparing them for the challenges
and opportunities of the future. Central to this journey has been our focus
on developing 21st-century skills, particularly critical and adaptive thinking
skills that empower our students to navigate an ever-changing world with
confidence, creativity, and resilience.</p>
